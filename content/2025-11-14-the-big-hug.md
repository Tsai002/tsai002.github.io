### 1. [The Partisan](https://youtu.be/xZkA3ku5ypI)

這首歌由二戰期間法國抵抗運動者 [Anna Marly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Marly) 作曲，[Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_d%27Astier_de_La_Vigerie) 作詞。[柯恩](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E9%87%8C%E5%A5%A5%E7%BA%B3%E5%BE%B7%C2%B7%E7%A7%91%E6%81%A9) 的翻唱使其廣為人知，而郭達年的版本在 [歌詞](https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-the-partisan-lyrics) 上去掉了法語內容，細節上略有不同。

<blockquote>

When they poured across the border\
I was cautioned to surrender\
**For that** I could not do\
I took my gun and vanished

I have changed my name so often\
I've lost my wife and children\
But I have many friends\
**They are all here with me now** (And some of them are with me)

An old woman gave us shelter\
Kept us hidden in the garret\
Then the soldiers came\
She died without a whisper

There were three of us this morning\
I'm the only one this evening\
But I must go on\
The frontiers are my prison

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing\
Through the graves the wind is blowing\
Freedom soon will come\
Then we'll come from the shadows

When they poured across the border\
I was cautioned to surrender\
**For that** I could not do

### 2. [New Stanzas for Amazing Grace](https://youtu.be/ZqtmsdQxaTw)

[艾倫·金斯堡](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E8%89%BE%E4%BC%A6%C2%B7%E9%87%91%E6%96%AF%E5%A0%A1) 改編自著名宗教曲目 Amazing Grace，因此被稱為 [New Stanzas for Amazing Grace](https://www.poetryverse.com/allen-ginsberg-poems/new-stanzas-for-amazing-grace)

<blockquote>

I dreamed I dwelled in a homeless place\
Where I was lost alone\
Folk looked right through me into space\
And passed with eyes of stone

O homeless hand on many a street\
Accept this change from me\
A friendly smile or word is sweet\
As fearless charity

Woe workingman who hears the cry\
And cannot spare a dime\
Nor look into a homeless eye\
Afraid to give the time

So rich or poor no gold to talk\
A smile on your face\
The homeless ones where you may walk\
Receive amazing grace

The homeless ones where you may walk\
Receive amazing grace

</blockquote>

### 3. [Everybody knows](https://youtu.be/xZkA3ku5ypI)

翻唱自柯恩的 Everybody knows，歌詞有 [修改](https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-everybody-knows-lyrics)。

<blockquote>

Everybody knows what is wrong\
Everybody knows what is right\
Everybody knows the past is gone\
Everybody knows tomorrow hasn't yet arrived\
Everybody knows we’ve got to love one another\
Or else we’re gonna fight each other\
That’s what we all know\
Everybody knows.

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded\
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed\
Everybody knows that the war is over\
Everybody knows that the good guys lost\
Everybody knows that the fight was fixed\
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich\
That's how it goes\
Everybody knows

And everybody knows that it's now or never\
Everybody knows that it's me or you\
And everybody knows that you live forever\
Ah, when you've done a line or two\
Everybody knows the deal is rotten\
Old Black Joe's still picking cotton\
For your ribbons and bows\
And everybody knows

And everybody knows that the plague is coming\
Everybody knows that it's moving fast\
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman\
Are just a shining artifact of the past\
Everybody knows the scene is dead\
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed\
That will disclose\
What everybody knows

Everybody knows what is wrong\
Everybody knows what is right\
Everybody knows the past is gone\
Everybody knows tomorrow hasn't yet arrived\
Everybody knows we’ve got to love one another\
Or else we’re gonna fight each other\
That’s what we all know\
Everybody knows.

Where are my brothers\

Where are my brothers\
Where is the family that take care of each other

Soon I will be done with the troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
Soon I will be done with the trobles of the world\
I'm gonna occupy my mind

No more weeping and wailing\
No more salvation seeking\
No more\
The children are dying\
Gonna occupy my life

They occupid your history\
They occupid your ancestry\
They occupid your village entrance and your identity\
So occupy your mother tongue\
Occupy your neighborhood\
Occupy your reality\
And do the best you could

They occupied your culture\
They occupied your frame of mind\
They occupied your future\
Whitewashed your past with lies\
So occupy your homeland\
Occupy your lives\
Occupy your birth-right\
Stand up to be ignited

They occupied your children\
They occupied their brains\
They occupied their visions\
And hold them by the reins

So occupy the campus\
Occupy the schools\
Occupy the workplace\
We don't need them rule

Soon I will be done with the troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
Soon I will be done with the trobles of the world\
Gonna occupy my mind

No more weeping and wailing\
no more big banks bailing\
no more killing and bleeding\
Gonna occupy my mind

They occupied your temples\
They occupied your saints\
Fuck up your faith in nature\
And dictate what you think\
So occupy your insights\
Occupy your inner-eyes\
Occupy your body\
Free your dreams and fly

They occupied your lifetimes\
They occupied your banner camps\
And assign your competitions\
And life is to die

So occupy the Wall Street\
Occupy the City Bank\
Occupy the People's Square\
Here comes the tank

They occupied Tibet\
They occupied Taiwan\
They occupied this motherland\
Proclaim the sovereignty aground\
We occupy Admiralty\
We shall occupy Shanghai\
We gonna re-occupy Tiananmen\
The people will survive

Soon I will be done with the troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
Soon I will be done with the trobles of the world\
I'm gonna occupy my mind

Where are my brothers\
Where are my sisters\
Where is the family that take care of each other\
Where are my sisters\
Where are my brothers\
Where is the family that take care of each other

### 8. [I ain't got no home anymore, Which side are you on？](https://youtu.be/0931AvbT2YI)

由 Woody Guthrie（電影《搖滾詩人》中躺床上那位） 和 Pete Seeger（電影《搖滾詩人》中爱德华·诺顿飾演的） 的兩首經典歌曲融合而成。

- [Woody Guthrie - I Ain't Got No Home](https://woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/I_Aint_Got_No_Home.htm)
- [Pete Seeger - Which Side Are You On?](https://genius.com/Pete-seeger-which-side-are-you-on-lyrics)

<blockquote>

I ain't got no home, I'm just a-roamin' 'round\
I'm just a daily toiler, roaming from town to town\
Police make it hard, wherever I may go\
I ain't got no home in this place anymore.

Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?\
Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?

Must I remind my brother\
Who's stranded on this road\
A dusty barren road millions feet have trod\
The rich man took my home\
And drove me from my door\
And I ain't got no home in this place anymore

Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?\
Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?

I've got my little family, my wife and darling child\
I just want a labor and earn them a decent life\
But the boss has made it hard\
For every dollar that he got\
And I ain't got no home in this place anymore

Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?\
Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?

My mother and my father\
Have long gone passed in time\
A stripped and bare livelihood borne by millions alive\
The government took our land\
To build their paradise\
And we ain't got no home in this place anymore

Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?\
Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?\
Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?\
Which side are you on, now?\
Which side are you on?

### 9. [Know Your Enemy](https://youtu.be/y6vDruKji-Q)

和平主義者 Christopher Logue 的詩作 [Know Your Enemy](https://www.wussu.com/poems/clkte.htm)，郭達年作曲。

<blockquote>

he doesn‘t care what colour you are\
provided you work for him\
he doesn‘t care how much you earn\
provided you earn more for him\
he doesn‘t care who lives at the top\
provided he owns the building\
he will let you write against him\
provided you do not act against him

he sings the praises of humanity\
but knows machines cost more than men\
Bargain with him, he laughs, and beats you at it\
challenge him, and he kills\
Sooner than loose the things he owns\
he will destroy the world\
SMASH The MONSTER NOW!

But as you hasten to be free\
And build your commonwealth\
Do not forget the enemy\
Who lies within yourself

KNOW THY ENEMY!\
KNOW THY ENEMY!\
KNOW THY ENEMY!\
KNOW THY ENEMY!

</blockquote>

### 10. [Come on in my Kitchen](https://youtu.be/8nR1PL0qTn8)

Robert Johnson 的 [藍調歌曲](https://genius.com/Robert-johnson-come-on-in-my-kitchen-take-1-lyrics)。

<blockquote>

So love is gone\
Fool around is no more\
Get on with your living\
Don't get floored\
You better come on into my kitchen\
It's gonna be raining outdoors

The bus shall fly\
Our dreams survive\
We are in no hope\
Don't get drowned\
You better come on into my kitchen\
It's gonna to be raining outdoors

Our seed grow strong\
In trust we bond\
Move on from the battle\
Don't get frowned\
You better come on into my kitchen\
It's gonna be raining outdoors

So winter is here\
It's gonna be slow\
We can't take the loser really\
That breaks our soul\
You better come on into my kitchen\
It's gonna be raining outdoors

So love is gone\
Fool around is no more\
Get on with your living\
Don't get floored\
You better come on into my kitchen\
It's gonna be raining outdoors

### 11. [我咽下一枚鐵做的月亮](https://youtu.be/F1R3N4cQu04)

[許立志](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E8%AE%B8%E7%AB%8B%E5%BF%97) 的詩作《我咽下一枚鐵做的月亮》，郭達年作曲。

<blockquote>

我咽下一枚鐵做的月亮\
他們把它叫作螺絲\
我咽下這工業的廢水，失業的訂單\
那些低於機台的青春早早夭亡\
我咽下奔波，咽下流離失所\
咽下人行天橋，咽下長滿水鏽的生活

我再咽不下了\
所有我曾經咽下的現在\
都從喉嚨洶湧而出\
在祖國的領土上鋪成一首\
恥辱的詩

</blockquote>

### 12. [Universal Soldier](https://youtu.be/moh3bhX1xhc)

反戰歌曲 [Universal Soldier](https://genius.com/Donovan-universal-soldier-lyrics)，歌詞由少許改變。

<blockquote>

He's five foot-two, and he's six feet-four\
He fights with missiles and with spears\
He's all of thirty-one\
And he's only seventeen\
He's been a soldier for a thousand years

He's a Catholic, a Hindu, an atheist, a Jain\
A Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew\
And he knows he shouldn't kill\
And he knows he always will\
Kill you for me, my friend, and me for you

And he's fighting for **Palestine**\
He's fighting for **Israle**\
He's fighting for the **USA**\
And he's fighting for **Afghanistan**\
And he's fighting for **Iraq**\
And he thinks we'll put an end to war this way

And he's fighting for democracy, he's fighting for the reds\
He says it's for the peace of us all\
He's the one who must decide\
Who's to live and who's to die\
And he never sees the writing on the wall\

But without him how would Hitler have condemned him at Libau?\
Without him Caesar would have stood alone\
He's the one who gives his body\
As a weapon of the war\
And without him all this killin' can't go on

He's the universal soldier, and he really is to blame\
His orders come from far away no more\
They come from here and there and you and me\
Sisters brothers can't you see\
This is not the way we put the end to war?

Unisversal soldier, he really is to blame\
His orders come from far away no more\
They come from here and there and you and me\
Sisters brothers can't you see\
This is not the way we put the end to war?

STOP TAKING LIVES!\
TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN!\
停止生命殺害生命\
照顧好我們的孩子

### 15. [Free the People NOW!](https://youtu.be/d7v4inzIluw)

約翰·藍儂的 [Bring on the Lucie (Freda Peeple)](https://genius.com/John-lennon-bring-on-the-lucie-freda-peeple-lyrics)

<blockquote>

We don't care what flag you're waving\
We don't even wanna know your name\
We don't care where you're from or where you're going\
All we know is that you came

You're making all our decisions\
We have just one demand of you\
You better go and think it over\
Here's something you just ought to do

Free the people now (do it, right now)\
Free the people now (do it, right now)

Well, we were caught with our hands in the air\
Don't despair, paranoia's everywhere\
We can shake it with love when we're scared\
So let's shout it aloud like a prayer

Free the people now (do it, right now)\
Free the people now (do it, right now)

We see through your paranoia\
But we don't want to play your game\
You think you're cool and know what you are doing\
666 is your name

So while you're jerking off each other\
You better bear this thought in mind\
Your time is up, you better know it\
But maybe you don't read the signs

Free the people now (do it, right now)\
Free the people now (do it, right now)

Well, you were caught with your hands in the kill\
And you still got to swallow your pill\
As you slip and you slide down the hill\
On the blood of the people you killed

Free the people now (do it, right now)\
Free the people now (do it, right now)

[路障戰歌](https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/music/lyrics/es/a-las-barricadas.htm)

<blockquote>

Negras tormentas agitan los aires\
nubes oscuras nos impiden ver\
aunque nos espere el dolor y la muerte\
contra el enemigo nos llama el deber

El bien más preciado es la libertad\
hay que defenderla con fe y valor

Alza la bandera revolucionaria\
que del triunfo sin cesar nos lleva en pos\
Alza la bandera revolucionaria\
que del triunfo sin cesar nos lleva en pos

大地騰起\
民聲鼎沸\
黑旗飄揚\
生命\
理想

我們都在路上\
一起同行\
安那其啊\
同志們

那心中的憧憬\
生活中的鬥爭\
從來沒有\
因為歲月\
而離棄

路上我們一起\
相互激勵\
安那其啊\
一直存在

Alza la bandera revolucionaria\
que del triunfo sin cesar nos lleva en pos\
Alza la bandera revolucionaria\
que del triunfo sin cesar nos lleva en pos
