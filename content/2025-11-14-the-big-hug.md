### 1. [The Partisan](https://youtu.be/xZkA3ku5ypI)

這首歌由二戰期間法國抵抗運動者 [Anna Marly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Marly) 作曲，[Emmanuel d'Astier de La Vigerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_d%27Astier_de_La_Vigerie) 作詞。[柯恩](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E9%87%8C%E5%A5%A5%E7%BA%B3%E5%BE%B7%C2%B7%E7%A7%91%E6%81%A9) 的翻唱使其廣為人知，而郭達年的版本在 [歌詞](https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-the-partisan-lyrics) 上去掉了法語內容，細節上略有不同。

When they poured across the border\
I was cautioned to surrender\
**For that** I could not do\
I took my gun and vanished

I have changed my name so often\
I've lost my wife and children\
But I have many friends\
**They are all here with me now** (And some of them are with me)

An old woman gave us shelter\
Kept us hidden in the garret\
Then the soldiers came\
She died without a whisper

There were three of us this morning\
I'm the only one this evening\
But I must go on\
The frontiers are my prison

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing\
Through the graves the wind is blowing\
Freedom soon will come\
Then we'll come from the shadows

When they poured across the border\
I was cautioned to surrender\
**For that** I could not do

### 2. [New Stanzas for Amazing Grace](https://youtu.be/ZqtmsdQxaTw)

[艾倫·金斯堡](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E8%89%BE%E4%BC%A6%C2%B7%E9%87%91%E6%96%AF%E5%A0%A1) 改編自著名宗教曲目 Amazing Grace，因此被稱為 [New Stanzas for Amazing Grace](https://www.poetryverse.com/allen-ginsberg-poems/new-stanzas-for-amazing-grace)

I dreamed I dwelled in a homeless place\
Where I was lost alone\
Folk looked right through me into space\
And passed with eyes of stone

O homeless hand on many a street\
Accept this change from me\
A friendly smile or word is sweet\
As fearless charity

Woe workingman who hears the cry\
And cannot spare a dime\
Nor look into a homeless eye\
Afraid to give the time

So rich or poor no gold to talk\
A smile on your face\
The homeless ones where you may walk\
Receive amazing grace

The homeless ones where you may walk\
Receive amazing grace

### 3. [Everybody knows](https://youtu.be/xZkA3ku5ypI)

翻唱自柯恩的 Everybody knows，歌詞有 [修改](https://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-everybody-knows-lyrics)。

Everybody knows what is wrong\
Everybody knows what is right\
Everybody knows the past is gone\
Everybody knows tomorrow hasn't yet arrived\
Everybody knows we’ve got to love one another\
Or else we’re gonna fight each other\
That’s what we all know\
Everybody knows.

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded\
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed\
Everybody knows that the war is over\
Everybody knows that the good guys lost\
Everybody knows that the fight was fixed\
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich\
That's how it goes\
Everybody knows

And everybody knows that it's now or never\
Everybody knows that it's me or you\
And everybody knows that you live forever\
Ah, when you've done a line or two\
Everybody knows the deal is rotten\
Old Black Joe's still picking cotton\
For your ribbons and bows\
And everybody knows

And everybody knows that the plague is coming\
Everybody knows that it's moving fast\
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman\
Are just a shining artifact of the past\
Everybody knows the scene is dead\
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed\
That will disclose\
What everybody knows

Everybody knows what is wrong\
Everybody knows what is right\
Everybody knows the past is gone\
Everybody knows tomorrow hasn't yet arrived\
Everybody knows we’ve got to love one another\
Or else we’re gonna fight each other\
That’s what we all know\
Everybody knows.

Where are my brothers\
Where are my sisters\
Where is the family that take care of each other\
Where are my sisters\
Where are my brothers\
Where is the family that take care of each other

Soon I will be done with the troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
Soon I will be done with the trobles of the world\
I'm gonna occupy my mind

No more weeping and wailing\
No more salvation seeking\
No more\
The children are dying\
Gonna occupy my life

They occupid your history\
They occupid your ancestry\
They occupid your village entrance and your identity\
So occupy your mother tongue\
Occupy your neighborhood\
Occupy your reality\
And do the best you could

They occupied your culture\
They occupied your frame of mind\
They occupied your future\
Whitewashed your past with lies\
So occupy your homeland\
Occupy your lives\
Occupy your birth-right\
Stand up to be ignited

They occupied your children\
They occupied their brains\
They occupied their visions\
And hold them by the reins

So occupy the campus\
Occupy the schools\
Occupy the workplace\
We don't need them rule

Soon I will be done with the troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
Soon I will be done with the trobles of the world\
Gonna occupy my mind

No more weeping and wailing\
no more big banks bailing\
no more killing and bleeding\
Gonna occupy my mind

They occupied your temples\
They occupied your saints\
Fuck up your faith in nature\
And dictate what you think\
So occupy your insights\
Occupy your inner-eyes\
Occupy your body\
Free your dreams and fly

They occupied your lifetimes\
They occupied your banner camps\
And assign your competitions\
And life is to die

So occupy the Wall Street\
Occupy the City Bank\
Occupy the People's Square\
Here comes the tank

They occupied Tibet\
They occupied Taiwan\
They occupied this motherland\
Proclaim the sovereignty aground\
We occupy Admiralty\
We shall occupy Shanghai\
We gonna re-occupy Tiananmen\
The people will survive

Soon I will be done with the troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
The troubles of the world\
Soon I will be done with the trobles of the world\
I'm gonna occupy my mind

Where are my brothers\
Where are my sisters\
Where is the family that take care of each other\
Where are my sisters\
Where are my brothers\
Where is the family that take care of each other
